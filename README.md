Project : Resume Screening NLP Project

Overview

This project aims to automate the resume screening process using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It involves building a model to analyze resumes and categorize them based on predefined criteria.

Project Structure

* data/: Contains the dataset(s) used for training and testing the model.

* models/: Stores the trained NLP model(s) and associated files.

* notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks used for exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation.

* src/: Python source code for data preprocessing, model training, and any other necessary scripts.

* requirements.txt: Lists all the dependencies required to run the project. Install them using pip install -r requirements.txt.
